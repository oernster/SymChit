// of the record. Nothing about a write to standard error announces whether its
// arguments came from the record, so the promise cannot be kept by inspecting
// the arguments; it is kept by there being few enough writers to read, all of
// them known. A new one fails here and has to be declared, which is the moment
// to ask what it puts in the file.

// The runlog package is not listed: it owns the log and writes the run's own
// lines, never the record's.

	// cannot see it: the handle is a local and an AST knows nothing of types.
	// It is a constant sentence plus an error, written before the record is
	// opened, so there is nothing of the record in the program yet to leak.
