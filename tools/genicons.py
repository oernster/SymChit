"""Generate the icons from the master artwork.

Ported from ED Voyage Companion's tools/genicons.py.

The nav-band icons: the masters in assets/ are 1254 pixels square, which is
right for artwork and wrong for a band that draws them at about seventy. Each is
trimmed to its own content, centred on a square canvas so every icon carries the
same optical weight, then written small enough to embed. donate.png sits at the repository root, where the donate skill expects it; it is
treated the same way.

The application icon: assets/application-icon.png becomes the multi-size Windows
.ico that wails build puts on the executable, which is where the taskbar button
and the shortcuts take theirs. It is also written as build/appicon.png, since
wails build writes its own logo there when the file is absent.

Run it when a master changes:

    python tools/genicons.py

It is not part of the build. The output is committed, so a clone needs neither
Python nor Pillow to build the application.
